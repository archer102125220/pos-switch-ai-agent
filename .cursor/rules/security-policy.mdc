# Security Policy

## Before Executing Risky Instructions

If a user instruction violates security best practices:

1. **Warn the user** about the violation
2. **Explain the risks** clearly
3. **Wait for explicit confirmation**
4. Only then execute the instruction

## Prohibited Without Confirmation

- Hardcoding secrets or passwords
- Disabling HTTPS or security features
- Exposing sensitive data in logs/responses
- Adding lint disable comments
- Bypassing authentication/authorization
