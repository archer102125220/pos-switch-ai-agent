# No Scripts for Code Refactoring

## Rule (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Using automated scripts (sed, awk, powershell, batch scripts) to modify code files.**

## Why

- Scripts only change text without understanding context or imports
- 2026-01-23 incident: `sed` changed `React.FormEvent` → `FormEvent` but forgot to add imports → compilation errors
- Code modification requires understanding context, import dependencies, and type systems

## Allowed Approaches

✅ Use AI tools for modifications:
- `replace_file_content` - for single contiguous edits
- `multi_replace_file_content` - for multiple non-contiguous edits
- **MUST verify imports are correct** after every change

## Forbidden Approaches

❌ Any script-based batch modification:
- `sed`, `awk`, `perl`
- `powershell -Command`, `powershell -File`
- `find ... -exec`
- Any text processing tool's batch replacement features

## Exception Process

If script usage is absolutely necessary:
1. **Get explicit human approval FIRST**
2. Show complete script for review
3. Explain why manual tools cannot accomplish the task
4. Only execute after developer approval

## Consequences for Violation

Violation is a **CRITICAL ERROR** and requires:
1. Immediately stop all work
2. Manually fix all affected files
3. Verify all modifications are correct
4. Document error cause and fix in commit message

## Remember

**Scripts are blind. AI should be intelligent.**
